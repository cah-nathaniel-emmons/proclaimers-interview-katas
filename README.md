# proclaimers-code-katas
This is a collection of interview coding exercises used by the Fuse teams. 

B## Getting Started
Clone this repo to get the full set of exercises related to a variety of technologies and concepts. The master branch contains many exercises in unsolved state. When adding a new exercise, be sure to provide enough scaffolding so that users can immediately build, run, test, deploy, etc. Our goal is to spend time evaluating a candidate's coding skills rather than their project setup and configuration skills.

## Solutions
Solutions should be available in clearly marked files. Where possible, the solutions should illustrate the the core concept of the exercise and should include tests.

## Exercises
This repository contains lists of exercises organized by technology. Subdirectories located under a top level technology directory should contain README files providing an overview of the exercise in addition to instructions for building, testing, and running the software.

### java-exercises
Exercises should include the ability to build and test via Maven/Gradle.

### javascript-exercises
Exercises should include ability to build and test via npm.

### rest-exercises
Exercises should include ability to build, test and run via Gradle. Please include API documentation for your REST service where applicable.
